<h2>Pymakr Atom Package</h2>

Pymakr enables you to communicate to your Pycom board using the build in command line REPL. Run a single file to your board, sync your entire project or directly type and execute commands.

    Works with Mac OSX, Linux and windows.
    Connects to any Pycom board: WiPy, WiPy2.0, LoPy and any newer board.
    Works best with firmware 1.6.11.b1 and higher. Earlier firmware might have unexpected behaviour when synchronizing files over serial.
